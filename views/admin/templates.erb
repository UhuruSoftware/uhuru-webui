  <h2>Templates</h2>


  <p>
    In order to upload and configure template applications, you can use a WebDAV client,
    and connect to <a target="_blank" href="http://<%= $config[:domain] %>/templates">http://<%= $config[:domain] %>/templates</a>
    using your credentials.
  </p>

  <h3>Windows</h3>

  <p>
    On Windows, you can map the path as a Network Drive.
    <br />

    Before doing so, you have to activate support for Basic Authentication.
    To do this, download and run the registry file from <a target="_blank" href="/tools/enable_basic_auth.reg">here</a>.

    <br />

    After you've run the registry file, open a command prompt (elevated as administrator) and run the following commands:
    <br/>
    <b>net stop webclient</b>
    <br/>
    <b>net start webclient</b>
    <br/>
    <b>net use u: http://<%= $config[:domain] %>/templates /user:[your username] [your password]</b>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please note that you can change the drive letter (u:) to anything else available on your machine.
    <br/>
    After these procedures are completed, you will be able to access the template store through the new Network Drive in My Computer.

  </p>

  <h3>Managing Template Apps</h3>

  <p>
    The template apps are organized and grouped in categories by "Publisher". Each publisher is represented by a folder in the root directory.
  </p>
  <p>
  To create a new category for a new publisher:
    <ul>
      <li>
        add a new folder in template_apps directory;<br/>
        the new folder name must have all characters lowercase
      </li>
      <li>
        in the new folder, add an image named "logo.png" â€“ which represents the publisher's logo;<br/>
        the image must be of size 64x64px, and it has to be a PNG.
      </li>
      <li>
        in the new folder, add a file named <b>publisher_manifest.yml</b> that contains the following:
        <pre style="background-color: #a9a9a9;">
name: Sample Apps
id: unique_id
description: This is a collection for test purposes in the web ui</pre>
        Where:
        <ul>
          <li>name is the name of the publisher</li>
          <li>id is a unique string and it must be the same as the folder name</li>
          <li>description is a short description of the publisher</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  After a category is created, or to an existing category, you can add as many template apps as you want.<br/>
  A template app is represented by a folder in a publisher folder.<br/>

    A template app folder contains:
    <ul>
      <li>
        an image named "logo.png" - this is the app's logo<br />
        this image should be 128x128px, and it has to be a PNG.
      </li>
      <li>
        the source code of the app, which can be a folder or a zip archive
      </li>
      <li>
        a file named "template_manifest.yml" that looks like this:
        <pre style="background-color: #a9a9a9;">
name: Wordpress
id: wordpress
tags: ['CMS', 'Large Project', 'Complex']
description: Free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL
uuid: 550e84ee-e29b-k1d4-a716-446655432702
can_download: true</pre>
        Where:
        <ul>
          <li>name is the name of the template app that will be displayed in the list</li>
          <li>id must be unique and the same as the name of the folder or zip that contains the app's source code</li>
          <li>tags are displayed in the info section of the app</li>
          <li>description is a bit of text detailing what the application does</li>
          <li>can_download specifies whether the app's source code can be directly downloaded from the web interface</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A file named "manifest.yml" that contains this:
        <pre style="background-color: #a9a9a9;">

applications:
  .:
    name: wptest
    framework:
      name: php
      info:
        mem: 128M
        description: PHP Application
        exec: !!null

    mem: '512'
    instances: 1

      wptestDB:
        type: mysql</pre>
        This is a typical manifest file of a Cloud Foundry app - you can generate this using the cf command line tool.
